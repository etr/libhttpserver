## Tl;dr

libhttpserver is a C++20 library for building high-performance RESTful HTTP
servers on top of [GNU libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/).
v2.0 is a lambda-first redesign: a working server is ten lines, handlers are
`std::function`s, responses are value-typed, and every public method is
thread-safe by contract.

**Features:**

- HTTP/1.1-compatible request parser
- RESTful-oriented interface
- Lambda-first handler API; class-form handlers (`http_resource`) when state is shared
- Value-typed responses with seven factories and fluent `with_*` chaining
- Cross-platform (Linux, *BSD, macOS, Windows / MSYS2-MinGW)
- Multiple threading models (internal poll, internal select, thread pool, external loop)
- IPv6 and dual-stack support
- Optional TLS (HTTPS) via GnuTLS, including mTLS, SNI, and TLS-PSK
- Optional Basic and Digest authentication (SHA-256, SHA-512/256, MD5)
- Optional centralized authentication with path-based skip rules
- Optional WebSocket support (requires libmicrohttpd built with WebSocket support)
- Response shapes for every common body: string, file, iovec scatter-gather, pipe streaming, deferred callback, empty, and 401-unauthorized
- Incremental POST processing (form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, file uploads)
- External event-loop integration (`run`, `run_wait`, `get_fdset`, `add_connection`)
- Daemon introspection (bound port, active connections, listen FD)
- Turbo mode, TCP_FASTOPEN, suppressed `Date` headers, configurable backlog
- IP access control with wildcard ranges — deny list (`deny_ip`) and allow list (`allow_ip`), IPv4 & IPv6
- Architecture contracts you can rely on: threading (DR-008 / §5.1) and error propagation (DR-009 / §5.2)

This README is a guided reference: it walks the v2.0 API surface section by
section. It is comprehensive but not exhaustive — the headers under
[`src/httpserver/`](src/httpserver/) are the source of truth, and the
[`examples/`](examples/) tree contains a runnable demonstration of every
feature.

The shortest possible server looks like this:

```cpp
// Copyright 2026 Sebastiano Merlino
// libhttpserver hello-world example — the lambda form.
// Compiles in ten lines including main(), with no http_resource subclass
// and no raw-pointer ownership. Production code typically qualifies names
// explicitly; the `using namespace` here is a one-off so this file can
// document the shortest possible end-to-end demo. See shared_state.cpp
// for the class-based pattern that is appropriate when handlers must
// share mutable state.
#include <httpserver.hpp>
using namespace httpserver;  // NOLINT(build/namespaces) - keep the demo at <=10 LOC
int main() {
    webserver ws{create_webserver(8080)};
    ws.on_get("/hello", [](const http_request&) {
        return http_response::string("Hello, World!");
    });
    ws.start(true);
}
```

The block above is reproduced byte-for-byte from
[`examples/hello_world.cpp`](examples/hello_world.cpp); a CI gate
(`scripts/check-readme.sh`) enforces the byte-for-byte equality.

## Introduction

libhttpserver is meant to constitute an easy system to build HTTP servers in
the REST fashion. It is built on top of [libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)
and, like its substrate, it is a daemon library. The mission is to expose
every useful HTTP capability through a simple, modern C++ API so that
application code can focus on business logic rather than on the mechanics of
HTTP request handling.

**Design.** libhttpserver is lambda-first. The shortest server is ten
lines and uses no inheritance; handlers are
`std::function<http_response(const http_request&)>`; responses are
value-typed with seven factories and fluent `with_*` chaining; ownership
of resource-form handlers is expressed in `std::unique_ptr` and
`std::shared_ptr`. The class form (`http_resource`) is the right shape
when several methods on one path share mutable state.

**Two contracts are load-bearing** — and both are stated explicitly in this
README rather than left implicit:

- **Thread-safety** (DR-008 / §5.1). Every public method on `webserver` is
  thread-safe and re-entrant from inside a handler, with two
  documented exceptions (`stop()`, `~webserver()`) that deadlock if invoked
  from a handler thread.
- **Error propagation** (DR-009 / §5.2). A handler that throws is caught
  by the dispatcher and routed through `internal_error_handler`. There is
  no throw-as-status idiom — to send a 404 from a handler, build it by value
  with `http_response::empty().with_status(404)`.

libhttpserver decodes form bodies automatically: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
and `multipart/form-data` are parsed into the request's argument map. Files
attached to multipart uploads are exposed through `http_request::get_files()`.

All functions are reentrant and thread-safe unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Clients can also specify resource limits on overall connection count, per-IP
connection count, and per-connection memory to avoid resource exhaustion.

## Requirements

libhttpserver can be used without any dependencies aside from libmicrohttpd.

The minimum versions required are:

* g++ >= 11 or clang >= 13 (Apple Clang from Xcode 15+)
* C++20 or newer
* libmicrohttpd >= 1.0.0
* *[Optionally]* for TLS (HTTPS) support, you'll need [libgnutls](http://www.gnutls.org/).
* *[Optionally]* to compile the code reference, you'll need [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).

On **RHEL 9** (and derivatives), the stock GCC 11 is too old for some C++20
library features the build relies on; install the `gcc-toolset-14` package
and `source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-14/enable` before configuring.

Additionally, for MinGW on Windows you will need:

* libwinpthread (for MinGW-w64, if you use thread model `posix` you already have this)

For versions before 0.18.0, on MinGW you will need:

* libgnurx >= 2.5.1

The test cases use [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) but you don't need
it to compile the library itself.

Please refer to the readme file for your particular distribution if there is
one for important notes.

| Platform | Toolchain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Debian 13 (trixie) | GCC 14.2 | Out-of-the-box |
| RHEL 9 | `gcc-toolset-14` | Stock GCC 11 is too old; install the Red Hat toolset overlay |
| RHEL 10 | GCC 14 | Out-of-the-box |
| FreeBSD 14.x | base Clang 18+ | Out-of-the-box |
| macOS | Homebrew GCC 15+ or current Apple Clang | Out-of-the-box |
| vcpkg / Conan | GCC 13+ / Clang 16+ | Out-of-the-box |

## Building and installation

libhttpserver uses the standard autotools workflow. The usual build process is:

```sh
./bootstrap
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
```

`make check` runs the test suite (unit + integration). `make examples`
builds every program under [`examples/`](examples/). `make dist` produces
a portable source tarball.

**ABI / packaging.** SOVERSION is 2. Distributions package
`libhttpserver2`, parallel-installable with prior major versions so
applications can link the major they need side by side. There is no
inline namespace and no symbol-versioning script.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Optional parameters to the configure script

A complete list of parameters can be obtained by running `./configure --help`.
The libhttpserver-specific options are listed below (the canonical configure
options are also supported):

* `--enable-same-directory-build` — enable in-tree builds. Strongly discouraged. *(default: no)*
* `--enable-debug` — enable debug data generation. *(default: no)*
* `--disable-doxygen-doc` — don't generate any Doxygen documentation. Doxygen is automatically invoked when present on the system and disabled otherwise.
* `--enable-fastopen` — enable use of TCP_FASTOPEN. *(default: yes)*
* `--enable-static` — enable static linking. *(default: yes)*

Build-time feature flags (auto-detected, can be forced):

* `--with-gnutls` / `--without-gnutls` — enable/disable TLS support. Sets the `HAVE_GNUTLS` macro.
* `--with-basic-auth` / `--without-basic-auth` — enable/disable Basic auth. Sets `HAVE_BAUTH`.
* `--with-digest-auth` / `--without-digest-auth` — enable/disable Digest auth. Sets `HAVE_DAUTH`.
* `--with-websocket` / `--without-websocket` — enable/disable WebSocket support. Sets `HAVE_WEBSOCKET`. Requires libmicrohttpd built with WebSocket support.

See [Feature availability](#feature-availability) for how each of these flags
affects the runtime API.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Building on Windows (MSYS2)

MSYS2 provides multiple shell environments with different purposes.
Understanding which shell to use is important:

| Shell | Host triplet | Runtime dependency | Use case |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|----------|
| **MinGW64** | `x86_64-w64-mingw32` | Native Windows | **Recommended** for native Windows apps |
| **MSYS** | `x86_64-pc-msys` | `msys-2.0.dll` | POSIX-style apps, build tools |

**Recommended: use the MinGW64 shell** for building libhttpserver to
produce native Windows binaries without additional runtime dependencies.

#### Step-by-step build instructions

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. Open the **MINGW64** shell (not the MSYS shell) from the Start Menu.
3. Install dependencies:

```sh
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,libtool,make,pkg-config,doxygen,gnutls,curl} autotools
```

4. Build and install [libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/) (>= 1.0.0).
5. Build libhttpserver:

```sh
./bootstrap
mkdir build && cd build
../configure --disable-fastopen
make
make check  # run tests
```

**Important:** the `--disable-fastopen` flag is required on Windows as
TCP_FASTOPEN is not supported there.

#### If you use the MSYS shell

Building from the MSYS shell also works, but the resulting binaries will
depend on `msys-2.0.dll`. The configure script will emit a warning when
building in this environment:

```
configure: WARNING: Building from MSYS environment. Binaries will depend on msys-2.0.dll.
```

Consider switching to the MinGW64 shell for native Windows binaries.

#### Library files on Windows

When building with GCC-based toolchains (MSYS2/MinGW, Cygwin), the
following library files are generated:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `libhttpserver.a` | Static library archive |
| `libhttpserver.dll` | Shared library (DLL) |
| `libhttpserver.dll.a` | Import library for linking against the DLL |
| `libhttpserver.la` | Libtool archive (used by libtool during linking) |

**Note about `.lib` files:** the `.dll.a` format is the import library format
used by GCC toolchains. If you're looking for `.lib` files, those are the
MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) import library format and are only generated
when building with the MSVC toolchain. The `.dll.a` file serves the same
purpose as `.lib` but for GCC-based compilers.

**Linking against libhttpserver:**

Using pkg-config (recommended):

```sh
g++ myapp.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libhttpserver) -o myapp
```

Manual linking:

```sh
g++ myapp.cpp -I/mingw64/include -L/mingw64/lib -lhttpserver -lmicrohttpd -o myapp
```

## Getting started — Hello, world

The Tl;dr at the top of this README contains the entire program. Walking
through it:

* `webserver ws{create_webserver(8080)};` — `create_webserver` is a fluent
  builder for the server configuration; `webserver` is constructed by
  direct initialisation from the builder. `webserver` is non-copyable and
  non-movable; pass it by reference once it exists. The constructor is
  `explicit`, so callers must direct-init rather than rely on implicit
  conversion.
* `ws.on_get("/hello", [](const http_request&) { ... });` — register a
  GET-only handler. The handler is a
  `std::function<http_response(const http_request&)>`. There is no
  subclass, no `shared_ptr`, no raw pointer. The seven HTTP-verb
  shortcuts are `on_get`, `on_post`, `on_put`, `on_delete`, `on_patch`,
  `on_options`, and `on_head`. For CONNECT and TRACE, use the
  `route(http_method::CONNECT, ...)` and `route(http_method::TRACE, ...)`
  forms covered under [Routing](#routing).
* `return http_response::string("Hello, World!");` — `http_response` is
  a value type. Factories on `http_response` build common shapes; the
  fluent `with_*` mutators add headers, footers, cookies, and status.
  The response is returned by value into the dispatcher.
* `ws.start(true);` — `true` means *block this thread until the server
  is stopped*. Pass `false` to start the listener and return immediately;
  later call `stop_and_wait()` from another thread.

To test the example, you can run the following from a terminal:

```sh
curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello
```

See [`examples/hello_world.cpp`](examples/hello_world.cpp) and
[`examples/hello_with_get_arg.cpp`](examples/hello_with_get_arg.cpp) for
the complete sources.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Class-form handlers

Lambdas suffice when each HTTP method is independent. When several methods
on one path share state — a counter, a cache, a mutex — derive from
[`http_resource`](src/httpserver/http_resource.hpp) and register the
subclass once:

```cpp
class counter : public httpserver::http_resource {
 public:
    httpserver::http_response render_get(const httpserver::http_request&) override {
        std::lock_guard lock{m_};
        return httpserver::http_response::string(std::to_string(n_));
    }
    httpserver::http_response render_post(const httpserver::http_request&) override {
        std::lock_guard lock{m_};
        ++n_;
        return httpserver::http_response::string(std::to_string(n_));
    }
 private:
    std::mutex m_;
    int n_ = 0;
};

// ...
ws.register_path("/count", std::make_unique<counter>());
```

The virtual hooks are `render_get`, `render_post`, `render_put`,
`render_delete`, `render_head`, `render_options`, `render_patch`,
`render_connect`, and `render_trace` — all lowercase, all returning
`http_response` by value. The `webserver` takes ownership of the
resource via `std::unique_ptr` (or a `std::shared_ptr` overload — see
[Routing](#routing)).

See [`examples/shared_state.cpp`](examples/shared_state.cpp) for the
canonical example.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Structures and classes type definition

This is the cast of types you will work with. Each is detailed further on
in its own section.

* **`webserver`** — represents the daemon listening on a socket for HTTP
  traffic. Non-copyable, non-movable. See [Create and work with a
  webserver](#create-and-work-with-a-webserver).
  * **`create_webserver`** — fluent builder for the configuration that
    `webserver`'s `explicit` constructor consumes. See the same section.
* **`http_resource`** — base class for a logical collection of HTTP
  methods bound to a path. Override the snake_case `render_*` virtuals.
  See [The resource object](#the-resource-object).
* **`http_request`** — the request passed to handlers. Read-only,
  single-threaded per request. See [Request](#request).
* **`http_response`** — the value-typed response. Seven factories cover
  every body shape; fluent `with_*` mutators add headers, footers,
  cookies, and status. See [Response](#response).
  * Factories: `http_response::string`, `http_response::file`,
    `http_response::iovec`, `http_response::pipe`, `http_response::empty`,
    `http_response::deferred`, `http_response::unauthorized`.
* **`http_method`** — strongly-typed enum of HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT,
  DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, CONNECT, TRACE). Declared in
  [`http_method.hpp`](src/httpserver/http_method.hpp).
* **`method_set`** — small bitset of `http_method` values, used by
  `route()` for atomic multi-method registration.
* **`iovec_entry`** — element type for `http_response::iovec` scatter-gather
  responses. A `{ void* base, size_t length }` pair where the base
  pointer is borrowed for the lifetime of the response.
* **`websocket_handler`** — base class for handling WebSocket
  connections; derive and implement `on_message`. See [WebSocket
  support](#websocket-support).
  * **`websocket_session`** — represents an active WebSocket connection;
    methods to send text, binary, ping/pong, and close frames.
* **`feature_unavailable`** — `std::runtime_error` subclass thrown when
  application code requests a feature that was compiled out (no TLS,
  no Basic auth, no Digest auth, no WebSocket). See [Feature
  availability](#feature-availability).

## Create and work with a webserver

Creating a webserver with a standard configuration is the one-liner shown
in the Tl;dr:

```cpp
webserver ws{create_webserver(8080)};
```

`create_webserver` is a *fluent builder*: every setter returns `*this` so
calls chain. The `webserver` constructor is **`explicit`**: callers must
direct-initialise (`webserver ws{cw};`) rather than rely on implicit
conversion. The builder validates eagerly where the input domain
is well-defined — `port` rejects values outside `[0, 65535]`, every `int`
setter rejects negatives, etc. — and raises `std::invalid_argument` at the
setter. Feature-gated settings (`use_ssl`, `basic_auth`, `digest_auth`,
WebSocket registration) are validated by the `webserver` constructor, not
the setter; so a builder configured for an unsupported feature throws
`feature_unavailable` from `webserver(create_webserver)` rather than from
the chained call.

A complete chained example:

```cpp
webserver ws{create_webserver(8080)
    .max_threads(4)
    .max_connections(1024)
    .connection_timeout(30)
    .start_method(http::http_utils::INTERNAL_SELECT)
    .turbo()
    .suppress_date_header()};
```

The rest of this section is a reference of every group of options.

### Basic startup options

* **`.port(uint16_t p)` / `.port(int p)`** — the port the server listens
  on. Can also be passed to the `create_webserver` constructor:
  `create_webserver(8080)`. The `int` overload exists so that
  out-of-`uint16_t` values like `70000` are expressible and rejected with
  `std::invalid_argument`; the `uint16_t` overload keeps type-safe call
  sites clean.
* **`.max_connections(int n)`** — maximum number of concurrent connections
  to accept. The default is `FD_SETSIZE − 4` (the maximum number of file
  descriptors supported by `select` minus four for `stdin`, `stdout`,
  `stderr`, and the server socket). That is, the default is as large as
  possible. Note that if you set a low limit, browsers doing request
  pipelining can saturate it.
* **`.max_threads(int n)`** — size of the internal worker pool, or 0 to
  spawn a thread per connection. Default 0.
* **`.memory_limit(int bytes)`** — per-connection memory limit. Default 0
  (libmicrohttpd default ≈ 32 kB).
* **`.content_size_limit(size_t bytes)`** — cap on individual request
  body size. Default `SIZE_MAX` (unlimited).
* **`.connection_timeout(int seconds)`** — idle timeout for a
  connection. Default 180.
* **`.per_IP_connection_limit(int n)`** — cap on concurrent connections
  from any single client IP. Default 0 (no limit).
* **`.max_thread_stack_size(int bytes)`** — stack size for internal
  worker threads. Default 0 (libmicrohttpd default).

### Listener, socket, and threading options

* **`.start_method(http::http_utils::start_method_T m)`** — pick the
  libmicrohttpd polling mode. Values include `INTERNAL_SELECT` (default),
  `INTERNAL_POLL`, `INTERNAL_EPOLL`, and `EXTERNAL_SELECT` (for use with
  `run` / `run_wait`).
* **`.bind_address(const sockaddr* a)` / `.bind_address(const std::string& ip)`** — bind
  to a specific address. The string overload accepts either IPv4
  (`"127.0.0.1"`) or IPv6 (`"::1"`).
* **`.bind_socket(int fd)`** — use a pre-existing listening socket.
  Useful for socket-activation setups (systemd, launchd).
* **`.use_ipv6(bool = true)`** — bind to an IPv6 socket. (Positive-polarity
  form; see [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the rename.)
* **`.use_dual_stack(bool = true)`** — accept both IPv4 and IPv6 on the
  same socket.
* **`.listen_socket(bool = true)`** — own the listening socket. Pass
  `false` when feeding connections in via `add_connection()`.
* **`.thread_safety(bool = true)`** — internal locking. Defaults to
  `true`; disable only if you understand the consequences.
* **`.alpn(bool = true)`** — enable ALPN negotiation for HTTPS.
* **`.listen_backlog(int n)`** — `listen(2)` backlog. Default 0
  (libmicrohttpd default).
* **`.address_reuse(int v)`** — `SO_REUSEADDR` / `SO_REUSEPORT` mode.
* **`.tcp_nodelay(bool = true)`** — disable Nagle on accepted sockets.
* **`.tcp_fastopen_queue_size(int n)`** — TCP_FASTOPEN queue size.
  Requires `--enable-fastopen` at configure time.
* **`.connection_memory_increment(size_t v)`** — incremental memory
  allocation per connection.
* **`.sigpipe_handled_by_app(bool = true)`** — tell libmicrohttpd that
  the application installs its own `SIGPIPE` handler.
* **`.client_discipline_level(int v)`** — strictness level for malformed
  request handling. `-1` means default.
* **`.turbo(bool = true)`** — enable libmicrohttpd's `USE_TURBO` flag
  (sacrifices some safety checks for performance).
* **`.suppress_date_header(bool = true)`** — omit the `Date:` response
  header (small perf win at the cost of one piece of HTTP metadata).

### Logging and validation

* **`.log_access(std::function<void(const std::string&)> cb)`** — invoked
  once per accepted request with a single-line summary suitable for an
  access log. Runs from MHD worker threads; **must be thread-safe**.
* **`.log_error(std::function<void(const std::string&)> cb)`** — invoked
  for errors the library decides are worth reporting. Same thread-safety
  contract.
* **`.validator(std::function<bool(const std::string&)> v)`** — called
  early on every request; returning `false` rejects the request.
* **`.unescaper(std::function<...> u)`** — overrides the URL-unescape
  step. Default unescaper handles the canonical HTTP escapes.

### Feature toggles (positive polarity)

* **`.basic_auth(bool = true)`** — enable Basic auth handling.
* **`.digest_auth(bool = true)`** — enable Digest auth handling.
* **`.use_ssl(bool = true)`** — enable TLS.
* **`.deferred(bool = true)`** — enable libmicrohttpd's deferred-response
  internal optimisations. Required to use `http_response::deferred(...)`.
* **`.debug(bool = true)`** — verbose libmicrohttpd debug output.
* **`.pedantic(bool = true)`** — strict HTTP-RFC parsing.
* **`.regex_checking(bool = true)`** — validate path regexes at
  registration. Default `true`.
* **`.ip_access_control(bool = true)`** — enable the IP access-control
  machinery used by `deny_ip` / `allow_ip` (and their `remove_*`
  counterparts). Default `true`. When `false`, every connection is
  admitted and both lists are ignored.
* **`.post_process(bool = true)`** — auto-parse `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  and `multipart/form-data` bodies into the request's argument map.
  Default `true`.
* **`.put_processed_data_to_content(bool = true)`** — also expose
  processed POST data through the raw content accessor.
* **`.single_resource(bool = true)`** — short-circuit the resource lookup
  when only one resource is registered.

> The feature toggles all use positive polarity: pass `false` to disable
> (`basic_auth(false)`, `use_ssl(false)`, etc.).

### TLS (HTTPS) options

These are no-ops unless the build has GnuTLS support. On a GnuTLS-off
build, `webserver(create_webserver{}.use_ssl(true))` throws
`feature_unavailable`.

* **`.https_mem_key(const std::string& path)`** — load the PEM key from
  the file at `path`.
* **`.https_mem_cert(const std::string& path)`** — load the PEM
  certificate from the file at `path`.
* **`.https_mem_trust(const std::string& path)`** — load CA certificate(s)
  for verifying client certificates (mTLS).
* **`.raw_https_mem_key(const std::string& pem)`**
  / **`.raw_https_mem_cert(...)`** / **`.raw_https_mem_trust(...)`** —
  pass PEM material directly without reading a file.
* **`.https_mem_dhparams(const std::string& pem)`** — explicit DH
  parameters.
* **`.https_key_password(const std::string& pw)`** — passphrase for an
  encrypted private key.
* **`.https_priorities(const std::string& s)`** — GnuTLS priority
  string.
* **`.https_priorities_append(const std::string& s)`** — append to the
  default priority string.
* **`.cred_type(http::http_utils::cred_type_T t)`** — `CERTIFICATE` /
  `PSK` / `NONE`. Default `NONE`.
* **`.psk_cred_handler(...)`** — PSK lookup callback for TLS-PSK.
* **`.sni_callback(...)`** — Server Name Indication lookup callback
  (returns the PEM `(cert, key)` pair for a hostname).

### Authentication setup

* **`.digest_auth_random(const std::string& s)`** — server-side random
  seed for digest nonces.
* **`.nonce_nc_size(int n)`** — replay-protection window size for
  digest auth.
* **`.auth_handler(auth_handler_ptr cb)`** — install a centralized
  authentication handler that runs before every resource's `render_*`
  call. The callback returns `std::nullopt` to allow the request to
  proceed, or an `http_response` (typically
  `http_response::unauthorized(realm)`) to reject it. Single source of
  truth for auth — see [Centralized
  authentication](#using-centralized-authentication).
* **`.auth_skip_paths(const std::vector<std::string>& paths)`** — paths
  to bypass `auth_handler`. Exact match (`"/health"`) and wildcard
  suffixes (`"/public/*"`) are both supported.

### Custom error handlers

* **`.not_found_handler(error_handler h)`** — invoked when no resource
  matches the request path (HTTP 404). The handler returns
  `http_response` by value.
* **`.method_not_allowed_handler(error_handler h)`** — invoked when a
  resource matches the path but not the HTTP method (HTTP 405).
* **`.internal_error_handler(internal_error_handler_t h)`** — invoked
  when a handler throws or the library hits an internal failure during
  dispatch. The handler signature is
  `http_response(const http_request&, std::string_view message)`. Load-bearing:
  see [Error propagation](#error-propagation).
* **`.expose_exception_messages(bool = true)`** — restores the v1
  behaviour of including the originating exception message in the
  **default** 500 response body. Default is `false`: the default body
  is the fixed string `"Internal Server Error"`
  ([DR-009 Revision 1](specs/architecture/11-decisions/DR-009.md),
  CWE-209 information-disclosure fix). The configured `log_error`
  callback continues to receive the verbatim message regardless of
  this flag — only the HTTP response body is affected.
  **Warning:** exception messages routinely contain file paths, SQL
  fragments, internal identifiers, and attacker-influenced input.
  Enable only in development or behind an explicit `#ifndef NDEBUG`
  guard. A configured `internal_error_handler` is unaffected — it
  always receives the message and can build any body it wants.

A worked example:

```cpp
auto cfg = httpserver::create_webserver(8080)
    .not_found_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&) {
        return httpserver::http_response::string("nope").with_status(404);
    })
    .method_not_allowed_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&) {
        return httpserver::http_response::empty().with_status(405);
    })
    .internal_error_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&, std::string_view what) {
        // CWE-209: 'what' may contain file paths, SQL fragments, or
        // attacker-influenced input. Log it internally; do NOT echo
        // it to the HTTP client.
        (void)what;  // e.g. logger->error(what);
        return httpserver::http_response::string("Internal Server Error").with_status(500);
    });
httpserver::webserver ws{cfg};
```

### File-upload options

* **`.file_upload_target(file_upload_target_T t)`** —
  `FILE_UPLOAD_MEMORY_ONLY` (default) keeps uploads in memory;
  `FILE_UPLOAD_DISK_ONLY` writes to disk; `FILE_UPLOAD_MEMORY_AND_DISK`
  does both.
* **`.file_upload_dir(const std::string& dir)`** — directory for
  on-disk uploads. Must not be empty.
* **`.generate_random_filename_on_upload(bool = true)`** — name uploaded
  files randomly (vs. trust the client's `Content-Disposition: filename=`).
* **`.file_cleanup_callback(file_cleanup_callback_ptr cb)`** — invoked
  after request completion to clean up uploaded files. Return `true` to
  delete the file from disk, `false` to keep it.

### Daemon / external event-loop options

These dovetail with the runtime methods covered under [Daemon
introspection and external event loops](#daemon-introspection-and-external-event-loops).
The `default_policy` selects which list is the exception list — i.e. what
happens to an address on neither list:

* **`.default_policy(http::http_utils::policy_T p)`** — `ACCEPT` (default)
  admits every address except those on the deny list (`deny_ip`); `REJECT`
  refuses every address except those on the allow list (`allow_ip`). Under
  either policy an allow entry overrides a matching deny entry.

### Runtime operations on `webserver`

Once constructed, the `webserver` instance exposes:

* **`bool start(bool blocking = false)`** — start listening. When
  `blocking == true`, this thread blocks until the server stops.
* **`bool stop()`** — stop the daemon and join libmicrohttpd's worker
  threads. **Calling this from inside a handler deadlocks** — see
  [Threading contract](#threading-contract).
* **`void stop_and_wait()`** — `stop()` then wait until every in-flight
  handler has returned. Same deadlock contract as `stop()`.
* **`bool is_running()`** — true if the daemon is currently accepting
  connections.

Registration verbs (covered in detail under [Routing](#routing)):
`on_get`, `on_post`, `on_put`, `on_delete`, `on_patch`, `on_options`,
`on_head`, `route(...)`, `register_path(...)`, `register_prefix(...)`,
`register_ws_resource(...)`, and the matching `unregister_*` forms.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## The resource object

The `http_resource` class represents a logical collection of HTTP methods
that will be associated with a URL when registered on the webserver. The
class is **designed for extension**. When the webserver matches a request
against a resource, the method corresponding to the request's HTTP verb
is called on the resource.

The `http_resource` class contains the following extensible methods
(also called *handlers* or *render methods*) — every one returns
`http_response` by value:

* **`http_response render_get(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP GET request.
* **`http_response render_post(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP POST request.
* **`http_response render_put(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP PUT request.
* **`http_response render_head(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP HEAD request.
* **`http_response render_delete(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP DELETE request.
* **`http_response render_trace(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP TRACE request.
* **`http_response render_options(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP OPTIONS request.
* **`http_response render_connect(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP CONNECT request.
* **`http_response render_patch(const http_request& req)`** — invoked on an HTTP PATCH request.
* **`http_response render(const http_request& req)`** — fallback invoked when no method-specific override is provided.

These methods are all `virtual`; override only the verbs your resource
supports. Unhandled verbs fall through to `render()`; if the resource also
does not override `render()`, the dispatch returns the configured 405
response.

### Restricting allowed methods

By default, every HTTP verb falls through to `render()`. To narrow a
resource to a specific subset of methods, use the `set_allowing` /
`disallow_all` API:

```cpp
class read_only : public httpserver::http_resource {
 public:
    read_only() {
        disallow_all();
        set_allowing("GET", true);
        set_allowing("HEAD", true);
    }
    httpserver::http_response render_get(const httpserver::http_request&) override {
        return httpserver::http_response::string("ok");
    }
};
```

Requests for disallowed verbs are short-circuited by the dispatcher and
land in the `method_not_allowed_handler` (HTTP 405) without calling
`render_*`. See [`examples/allowing_disallowing_methods.cpp`](examples/allowing_disallowing_methods.cpp)
for a worked example.

### Ownership

Resources are passed to the webserver via `std::unique_ptr` (the
webserver takes exclusive ownership) or `std::shared_ptr` (caller and
webserver share ownership). Ownership is always expressed through a
smart pointer.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Routing

The `webserver` exposes three families of registration entry points.
They are all interoperable: within one server, some paths can be
lambdas and others can be `http_resource` subclasses.

### Lambda form: per-method, exact path

`on_get`, `on_post`, `on_put`, `on_delete`, `on_patch`, `on_options`,
`on_head` — each takes an exact path and a
`std::function<http_response(const http_request&)>`:

```cpp
ws.on_get("/hello", [](const http_request&) {
    return http_response::string("Hello, World!");
});
ws.on_post("/items", [](const http_request& req) {
    return http_response::string("created: " + std::string{req.get_arg("name")})
        .with_status(201);
});
```

Re-registering the same `(method, path)` pair throws. The seven
shortcuts cover the seven verbs with first-class handler functions;
CONNECT and TRACE go through `route()` (below).

### Lambda form: atomic multi-method via `route()`

`route()` is the primary escape hatch when the HTTP method is known
only at runtime (e.g. loaded from config, selected from a dispatch
table). The single-method form:

```cpp
route(http_method m, "/info", handler)
```

takes a runtime `http_method` value and is the canonical form for
config-driven or table-driven registration (PRD-HDL-REQ-006).

`route(method_set methods, "/info", handler)` additionally allows
registering a handler under several methods in a single critical
section — either every slot is registered, or none of them are:

```cpp
ws.route(http_method::GET | http_method::HEAD, "/info",
         [](const http_request&) {
             return http_response::string("info");
         });
```

A `method_set` is the bitwise-or of `http_method` values. This is the
only entry point through which CONNECT and TRACE are reachable as
lambdas: `route(http_method::CONNECT, "/proxy", handler)`.

### Resource form: `register_path` and `register_prefix`

For `http_resource` subclasses (the [class form](#class-form-handlers)):

```cpp
ws.register_path("/count",   std::make_unique<counter>());   // exact match
ws.register_prefix("/static", std::make_unique<files>());    // subtree match
```

Both methods have `std::shared_ptr<http_resource>` overloads for the
case where you need to retain a reference to the resource:

```cpp
auto cnt = std::make_shared<counter>();
ws.register_path("/count", cnt);
// cnt is still usable from outside the webserver.
```

**Parameterised paths.** Brace syntax captures path segments:

```cpp
ws.register_path("/users/{id}", std::make_unique<user_resource>());
```

The captured value is available inside the handler via
`http_request::get_arg("id")`.

**Per-segment regex constraints.** Add a regex after a pipe to constrain
a segment:

```cpp
ws.register_path("/users/{id|[0-9]+}", std::make_unique<user_resource>());
```

Only requests where the `id` segment matches `[0-9]+` will match this
registration.

Regex validation is on by default; disable with `regex_checking(false)`
on the builder if you need pure literal-path semantics.

**Unregistration.** `unregister_path(path)` and `unregister_prefix(path)`
remove a previously registered resource by path. (`unregister_resource`
exists as a deprecated alias for `unregister_path`.)

### A note on `register_resource`

`register_resource(path, resource)` is a deprecated alias for
`register_path` retained for migration convenience and marked
`[[deprecated]]`. New code should call `register_path` for exact
matches and `register_prefix` for subtrees.

## Request

`http_request` is read-only inside a handler. The accessors are designed
around `std::string_view` so reading headers and arguments does not
allocate.

### Path, method, version

| Accessor | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_path()` | `std::string_view` | The decoded path |
| `get_path_pieces()` | `const std::vector<...>&` | Split path components |
| `get_method()` | `httpserver::http_method` | Strongly-typed enum; see [`http_method.hpp`](src/httpserver/http_method.hpp) |
| `get_version()` | `std::string_view` | `"HTTP/1.1"`, `"HTTP/2"`, … |
| `get_querystring()` | `std::string_view` | Raw query string (no decoding) |
| `get_connection_id()` | uintptr-style id | Stable identifier for the underlying connection |
| `get_requestor()` | `std::string_view` | Connecting peer's IP address (text form) |
| `get_requestor_port()` | `unsigned short` | Connecting peer's port |

### Headers, arguments, cookies

| Accessor | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_headers()` | `const map&` | All request headers |
| `get_header(name)` | `std::string_view` | First value for a named header |
| `get_args()` | `const map&` | All query / form arguments |
| `get_arg(name)` | `std::string_view` | First value for a query / form arg |
| `get_arg_flat(name)` | `std::string_view` | Alias for `get_arg`; explicit "first value only" form |
| `get_cookies()` | `const map&` | All cookies |
| `get_cookie(name)` | `std::string_view` | First value for a named cookie |
| `get_footers()` | `const map&` | Chunked trailers |

### Uploaded files (multipart)

| Accessor | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_files()` | `const map&` | Uploaded files keyed by form field name |
| `get_content()` | `std::string_view` | The raw request body |
| `get_content_size_limit()` | `size_t` | Configured cap, in bytes |

See [`examples/file_upload.cpp`](examples/file_upload.cpp) and
[`examples/file_upload_with_callback.cpp`](examples/file_upload_with_callback.cpp)
for working programs.

### Authentication accessors

| Accessor | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_user()` | `std::string_view` | Basic-auth user; empty when `HAVE_BAUTH` is off |
| `get_pass()` | `std::string_view` | Basic-auth password; empty when `HAVE_BAUTH` is off |
| `get_digested_user()` | `std::string_view` | Digest-auth user; empty when `HAVE_DAUTH` is off |
| `check_digest_auth(realm, password, nonce_timeout, signal_stale, algo)` | `digest_auth_result` | Validates a digest auth response against a plaintext password |
| `check_digest_auth_digest(realm, ha1, ...)` | `digest_auth_result` | Same as above but against a pre-computed HA1 hash |

> **Security note.** Basic auth (`get_user`/`get_pass`) transmits
> credentials as Base64 — effectively cleartext. Digest auth
> (`get_digested_user`) avoids transmitting the password but is still
> vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks without TLS. Both are only
> safe when the server is configured with TLS (`HAVE_GNUTLS`, `.use_ssl(true)`).
> See [Feature availability](#feature-availability) and
> [`examples/basic_authentication.cpp`](examples/basic_authentication.cpp).

`digest_auth_result` is a strongly-typed enum:

* `OK` — authentication succeeded.
* `NONCE_STALE` — the nonce is stale; signal the client to retry with a fresh nonce by setting `signal_stale = true` in the response.
* `WRONG_USERNAME`, `WRONG_REALM`, `WRONG_URI`, `WRONG_QOP`, `WRONG_ALGO`, `RESPONSE_WRONG` — specific reasons for failure.
* `WRONG_HEADER`, `TOO_LARGE`, `NONCE_WRONG`, `NONCE_OTHER_COND`, `ERROR` — other failure conditions.

### TLS / client-certificate accessors

When the build was compiled with GnuTLS (`HAVE_GNUTLS`) **and** the
client presented an X.509 certificate during the TLS handshake, these
accessors return the certificate details. On a non-TLS build, or when
the client did not present a certificate, they return empty / `-1` /
`false`:

| Accessor | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `has_client_certificate()` | `bool` | True if a client cert was presented |
| `is_client_cert_verified()` | `bool` | True if the chain validated against the configured trust store |
| `get_client_cert_dn()` | `std::string_view` | Subject Distinguished Name |
| `get_client_cert_issuer_dn()` | `std::string_view` | Issuer Distinguished Name |
| `get_client_cert_cn()` | `std::string_view` | Subject Common Name |
| `get_client_cert_fingerprint_sha256()` | `std::string_view` | Hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint |
| `get_client_cert_not_before()` | `time_t` | Validity-start timestamp; `-1` if unavailable |
| `get_client_cert_not_after()` | `time_t` | Validity-end timestamp; `-1` if unavailable |

See [`examples/client_cert_auth.cpp`](examples/client_cert_auth.cpp) for a
worked mTLS example.

### Lifetime contract

Every `string_view` returned by `http_request` is valid for the duration
of the handler invocation **and no longer**. Copy what you need to keep
(e.g. into a `std::string`); do not hand a view to a deferred callback.
The references returned by `get_headers()`, `get_args()`,
`get_path_pieces()`, `get_files()`, and `get_cookies()` follow the same
rule. `http_request` is **single-threaded per request**: sharing one
`http_request` across threads is undefined.

### Method enum

`http_method` (declared in
[`http_method.hpp`](src/httpserver/http_method.hpp)) covers the canonical
HTTP methods. `method_set` is a bitset used by atomic multi-method
registration on `route()` (see [Routing](#routing)).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Response

`http_response` is a **value type** — move-only, returned by value,
never `shared_ptr`-wrapped. There is no class hierarchy of body
subclasses; the body shape is a runtime detail of one type. Build a
response with one of the seven factories described below and decorate
it with the fluent `with_*` mutators.

### The seven factories

| Factory | Body shape | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `http_response::string(body, [status, content_type])` | In-memory string (small bodies live inline via SBO) | The body is already in memory |
| `http_response::file(path)` | Stream a file from disk | The body is a static or generated file on disk |
| `http_response::iovec(entries)` | Scatter-gather over a vector of `iovec_entry` (zero-copy) | The body is assembled from several existing buffers |
| `http_response::pipe(fd)` | Stream from a pipe / FIFO | The body is being produced by another process or thread |
| `http_response::empty([status])` | Empty body | 204 No Content, redirects, HEAD responses |
| `http_response::deferred(producer, [closure, content_type])` | Body produced incrementally by a callback | The body cannot be materialised up-front (long-poll, streaming) |
| `http_response::unauthorized(realm, [status, content_type, algorithm])` | 401 with the proper `WWW-Authenticate` header | Reject a request that lacks valid credentials |

`iovec_entry` is the element type of the `iovec()` vector:

```cpp
struct iovec_entry {
    const void* base;   // borrowed for the response's lifetime
    size_t length;
};
```

The `base` pointer is **borrowed**: the caller must keep the underlying
storage alive until the response has been fully written to the wire.
For owning scatter-gather, copy your strings into a `std::vector<std::string>`
that the response captures by value.

### Fluent mutation

Every `http_response` exposes `with_status`, `with_header`, `with_footer`,
and `with_cookie`. These return `*this` (by reference on lvalues, by
rvalue-reference on rvalues), so calls can chain:

```cpp
return httpserver::http_response::string("hi")
    .with_header("X-Trace-Id", trace_id)
    .with_status(201);
```

The fluent helpers are intentionally narrow — every other mutation
(content type, body data) is set at the factory call. This keeps the
"build it, return it, done" idiom uniform across response shapes.

### Building error responses by value

There is **no throw-as-status idiom**. To return a 404 from a handler,
build it explicitly:

```cpp
if (!found) {
    return httpserver::http_response::empty().with_status(404);
}
```

Or with a body:

```cpp
return httpserver::http_response::string("user not found").with_status(404);
```

For 401 responses, the dedicated `http_response::unauthorized` factory
sets the right `WWW-Authenticate` header for you:

```cpp
return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized("MyRealm");
```

See [`examples/setting_headers.cpp`](examples/setting_headers.cpp),
[`examples/iovec_response_example.cpp`](examples/iovec_response_example.cpp),
[`examples/minimal_file_response.cpp`](examples/minimal_file_response.cpp),
[`examples/pipe_response_example.cpp`](examples/pipe_response_example.cpp),
[`examples/empty_response_example.cpp`](examples/empty_response_example.cpp),
[`examples/minimal_deferred.cpp`](examples/minimal_deferred.cpp), and
[`examples/binary_buffer_response.cpp`](examples/binary_buffer_response.cpp)
for working programs covering every response shape.

## IP blocking and unblocking

libhttpserver supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and manages them transparently.
The only requirement for IPv6 is that it is enabled on the underlying
server — set `use_ipv6(true)` on `create_webserver` (or `use_dual_stack(true)`
for both stacks on the same socket).

You can populate the deny list and the allow list (with individual IPs or
wildcard ranges) at runtime using these methods on `webserver`:

* **`void deny_ip(std::string_view ip)`** — add one IP (or a range,
  e.g. `"127.0.0.*"`) to the deny list. Connections from a matching
  address are refused at the policy callback. This is the exception list
  under the default `ACCEPT` policy.
* **`void remove_denied_ip(std::string_view ip)`** — remove one IP (or a
  range) from the deny list. Idempotent: removing an entry that is not
  currently denied is a no-op.
* **`void allow_ip(std::string_view ip)`** — add one IP (or a range) to
  the allow list. This is the exception list under the `REJECT` policy
  (permit only these). Under `ACCEPT`, an allow entry overrides a
  matching `deny_ip` entry.
* **`void remove_allowed_ip(std::string_view ip)`** — remove one IP (or a
  range) from the allow list. Idempotent.

### IP string format

The IP string format can represent both IPv4 and IPv6. Addresses are
normalised internally by the webserver to a common representation, so
any valid IPv4 or IPv6 textual representation works. To express a
range, omit the octet you want to wildcard and specify `'*'` in its
place.

Examples of valid IPs include:

* `"192.168.5.5"` — standard IPv4
* `"192.168.*.*"` — range of IPv4 addresses; in the example, everything between `192.168.0.0` and `192.168.255.255`
* `"2001:db8:8714:3a90::12"` — standard IPv6; clustered empty ranges are fully supported
* `"2001:db8:8714:3a90:*:*"` — range of IPv6 addresses
* `"::ffff:192.0.2.128"` — IPv4 nested into IPv6
* `"::192.0.2.128"` — IPv4 nested into IPv6 (without the `ffff` prefix)
* `"::ffff:192.0.*.*"` — ranges of IPv4 IPs nested into IPv6

### Allow-list mode

By default (`ACCEPT` policy) the deny list is the exception list: use
`deny_ip` to refuse specific addresses and admit everyone else. To invert
this into an allow list — refuse everyone except specific addresses — set
the default policy to `REJECT` and populate the allow list with `allow_ip`:

```cpp
webserver ws{create_webserver(8080)
    .default_policy(http::http_utils::REJECT)};
ws.allow_ip("192.168.0.*");  // permits 192.168.0.0/24, refuses everything else
```

See [`examples/minimal_ip_access_control.cpp`](examples/minimal_ip_access_control.cpp)
for a worked example of both modes.

## Authentication

libhttpserver supports four authentication mechanisms, all of which can
be combined freely (e.g. mTLS *and* digest auth in a two-factor
configuration):

* **Basic authentication** — username and password are exchanged in
  clear (base64-encoded) between the client and the server. Use only
  for non-sensitive content or under HTTPS. With Basic auth, the
  application sees the cleartext password — useful for chained
  authentication against an external store. Enable / disable with
  `basic_auth(true|false)` on the builder.
* **Digest authentication** — a one-way authentication scheme based on
  hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, or SHA-512/256). Only the hash transits
  the network; a server-issued nonce prevents replay attacks. Appropriate
  for general use, especially when HTTPS is not available. SHA-256 is the
  default; SHA-512/256 is also supported for stronger security. Enable /
  disable with `digest_auth(true|false)`.
* **Client-certificate authentication (mTLS)** — uses an X.509
  certificate from the client. The strongest of the three mechanisms,
  but requires HTTPS. Combines well with Basic or Digest for layered
  authentication. Enable with `use_ssl(true)` plus configured `https_mem_trust`.
* **Centralized authentication** — a single per-request callback that
  runs *before* any resource's render method, so individual handlers
  don't need to repeat auth code. Configured via `auth_handler` and
  `auth_skip_paths` on the builder.

### Using Basic authentication

```cpp
class user_pass_resource : public httpserver::http_resource {
 public:
    httpserver::http_response render_get(const httpserver::http_request& req) override {
        if (req.get_user() != "myuser" || req.get_pass() != "mypass") {
            return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized("test@example.com");
        }
        return httpserver::http_response::string(
            std::string{req.get_user()} + " " + std::string{req.get_pass()});
    }
};

int main() {
    httpserver::webserver ws{httpserver::create_webserver(8080)};
    ws.register_path("/hello", std::make_unique<user_pass_resource>());
    ws.start(true);
}
```

To test:

```sh
curl -XGET -v -u myuser:mypass http://localhost:8080/hello
```

You will get back the user and password you passed. Try passing wrong
credentials to see the failure response. See
[`examples/basic_authentication.cpp`](examples/basic_authentication.cpp)

### Using Digest authentication

`check_digest_auth` returns a `digest_auth_result` enum with fine-grained
status codes (see [Request](#request) for the full list). The skeleton
of a digest-protected handler is:

```cpp
httpserver::http_response render_get(const httpserver::http_request& req) override {
    if (req.get_digested_user().empty()) {
        return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized(
            "test@example.com", 401, "text/plain",
            httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_algorithm::SHA_256);
    }
    auto result = req.check_digest_auth(
        "test@example.com", "mypass", 300, 0,
        httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_algorithm::SHA_256);
    if (result == httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_auth_result::NONCE_STALE) {
        return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized(
            "test@example.com", 401, "text/plain",
            httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_algorithm::SHA_256)
            .with_header("Stale", "true");
    }
    if (result != httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_auth_result::OK) {
        return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized(
            "test@example.com", 401, "text/plain",
            httpserver::http::http_utils::digest_algorithm::SHA_256);
    }
    return httpserver::http_response::string("SUCCESS");
}
```

To test:

```sh
curl -XGET -v --digest --user myuser:mypass localhost:8080/hello
```

You'll get `SUCCESS` in response; observe the response message in detail
to see the full digest handshake. See
[`examples/digest_authentication.cpp`](examples/digest_authentication.cpp).

### Using centralized authentication

The per-resource pattern above duplicates auth logic across every
resource. Centralized authentication lets you define the policy once and
have it applied automatically to every request:

```cpp
// auth runs once per request before any render_*; return std::nullopt to allow
auto auth = [](const httpserver::http_request& req)
    -> std::optional<httpserver::http_response> {
    if (req.get_user() != "admin" || req.get_pass() != "secret") {
        return httpserver::http_response::unauthorized("MyRealm");
    }
    return std::nullopt;
};

httpserver::webserver ws{httpserver::create_webserver(8080)
    .auth_handler(auth)
    .auth_skip_paths({"/health", "/public/*"})};

ws.register_path("/api",    std::make_unique<api_resource>());
ws.register_path("/health", std::make_unique<health_resource>());
ws.start(true);
```

The `auth_handler` callback runs for every request before the resource's
render method. It receives the `http_request` and can:

* Return `std::nullopt` to allow the request to proceed normally.
* Return an `http_response` (typically `http_response::unauthorized`) to
  reject the request. The response is moved onto the wire by the
  dispatcher; no heap allocation is required.

`auth_skip_paths` accepts a vector of paths that should bypass the
handler:

* Exact matches: `"/health"` matches only `/health`.
* Wildcard suffixes: `"/public/*"` matches `/public/`, `/public/info`,
  `/public/docs/api`, etc.

To test (without auth — returns 401):

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:8080/api
```

With valid auth — returns 200:

```sh
curl -u admin:secret http://localhost:8080/api
```

Health endpoint (skip path) — works without auth:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

See [`examples/centralized_authentication.cpp`](examples/centralized_authentication.cpp).

### Using client-certificate authentication (mTLS)

Client-certificate authentication (mutual TLS, mTLS) provides strong
authentication by requiring the client to present an X.509 certificate
during the TLS handshake. To enable mTLS:

1. `use_ssl(true)` — enable TLS.
2. `https_mem_key("server_key.pem")` and `https_mem_cert("server_cert.pem")` — server certificate.
3. `https_mem_trust("ca_cert.pem")` — CA certificate(s) to verify client certificates.

```cpp
class secure : public httpserver::http_resource {
 public:
    httpserver::http_response render_get(const httpserver::http_request& req) override {
        if (!req.has_client_certificate()) {
            return httpserver::http_response::string("client certificate required")
                .with_status(401);
        }
        if (!req.is_client_cert_verified()) {
            return httpserver::http_response::string("certificate not verified")
                .with_status(403);
        }
        std::string cn{req.get_client_cert_cn()};
        return httpserver::http_response::string("Welcome, " + cn + "!");
    }
};

int main() {
    httpserver::webserver ws{httpserver::create_webserver(8443)
        .use_ssl(true)
        .https_mem_key("server_key.pem")
        .https_mem_cert("server_cert.pem")
        .https_mem_trust("ca_cert.pem")};
    ws.register_path("/secure", std::make_unique<secure>());
    ws.start(true);
}
```

Available client-certificate methods (require GnuTLS support):

* `has_client_certificate()` — was a client cert presented?
* `is_client_cert_verified()` — did the chain validate?
* `get_client_cert_dn()` — subject Distinguished Name
* `get_client_cert_issuer_dn()` — issuer Distinguished Name
* `get_client_cert_cn()` — Common Name from the subject
* `get_client_cert_fingerprint_sha256()` — hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint
* `get_client_cert_not_before()` / `get_client_cert_not_after()` — validity window

Test with a client certificate:

```sh
curl -k --cert client_cert.pem --key client_key.pem https://localhost:8443/secure
```

Without a client certificate (will be rejected):

```sh
curl -k https://localhost:8443/secure
```

See [`examples/client_cert_auth.cpp`](examples/client_cert_auth.cpp).

### Server Name Indication (SNI) callback

SNI lets a server host multiple TLS certificates on a single IP address.
The client indicates which hostname it's connecting to during the TLS
handshake, and the server can select the appropriate certificate.
Configure an SNI callback that returns the `(cert_pem, key_pem)` pair for
each server name:

```cpp
std::map<std::string, std::pair<std::string, std::string>> certs;

auto sni = [](const std::string& server_name)
    -> std::pair<std::string, std::string> {
    auto it = certs.find(server_name);
    if (it != certs.end()) return it->second;
    return {"", ""};  // fall back to the default certificate
};

httpserver::webserver ws{httpserver::create_webserver(443)
    .use_ssl(true)
    .https_mem_key("default_key.pem")
    .https_mem_cert("default_cert.pem")
    .sni_callback(sni)};
```

SNI support requires libmicrohttpd 1.0.0 or later compiled with GnuTLS.

### TLS-PSK (pre-shared key)

For environments where X.509 certificates are impractical, libhttpserver
also supports TLS-PSK via `cred_type(http::http_utils::PSK)` plus a
`psk_cred_handler` callback returning the PSK for a given identity. See
[`examples/minimal_https_psk.cpp`](examples/minimal_https_psk.cpp).

## WebSocket support

libhttpserver provides WebSocket support when libmicrohttpd is built
with WebSocket functionality. To use WebSockets, derive from the
`websocket_handler` class and implement `on_message`.

### The `websocket_handler` class

The `websocket_handler` class provides the following virtual methods:

* **`void on_open(websocket_session& session)`** — called when a new WebSocket connection is established. Default implementation does nothing.
* **`void on_message(websocket_session& session, std::string_view msg)`** — called when a text message is received. **This is the only pure virtual method and must be implemented.**
* **`void on_binary(websocket_session& session, const void* data, size_t len)`** — called when a binary message is received. Default implementation does nothing.
* **`void on_ping(websocket_session& session, std::string_view payload)`** — called when a ping frame is received. Default implementation sends a pong.
* **`void on_close(websocket_session& session, uint16_t code, const std::string& reason)`** — called when the WebSocket connection is closed. Default implementation does nothing.

### The `websocket_session` class

The `websocket_session` class provides methods to interact with the
client:

* **`void send_text(const std::string& msg)`** — send a text message.
* **`void send_binary(const void* data, size_t len)`** — send a binary message.
* **`void send_ping(const std::string& payload = "")`** — send a ping frame.
* **`void send_pong(const std::string& payload = "")`** — send a pong frame.
* **`void close(uint16_t code = 1000, const std::string& reason = "")`** — close the WebSocket connection.
* **`bool is_valid()`** — true while the session is still open.

### Registering WebSocket resources

WebSocket handlers are registered with `register_ws_resource`, which
takes ownership of a `websocket_handler` subclass via `std::unique_ptr`
(or shares it via `std::shared_ptr`):

```cpp
class echo : public httpserver::websocket_handler {
 public:
    void on_message(httpserver::websocket_session& session,
                    std::string_view msg) override {
        session.send_text("Echo: " + std::string{msg});
    }
};

int main() {
    httpserver::webserver ws{httpserver::create_webserver(8080)};
    ws.register_ws_resource("/echo", std::make_unique<echo>());
    // or, with shared ownership:
    auto handler = std::make_shared<echo>();
    ws.register_ws_resource("/echo2", handler);
    ws.start(true);
}
```

On a build with `HAVE_WEBSOCKET` disabled — for example, when the system
libmicrohttpd was built without WebSocket support — `register_ws_resource`
throws `feature_unavailable`. See [Feature
availability](#feature-availability) for how to detect this at runtime
without preprocessor gates, and
[`examples/websocket_echo.cpp`](examples/websocket_echo.cpp) for a
worked example.

## Daemon introspection and external event loops

libhttpserver exposes several methods for integrating with external
event loops and for querying daemon state at runtime.

### Daemon introspection

* **`uint16_t webserver::get_bound_port()`** — actual port the daemon is
  bound to. Especially useful when you pass port `0` to let the OS
  choose an ephemeral port.
* **`int webserver::get_listen_fd()`** — the listen socket file
  descriptor, or `-1` if not available.
* **`unsigned int webserver::get_active_connections()`** — the number of
  currently active connections.
* **`bool webserver::is_running()`** — true if the daemon is currently
  accepting connections.

### External event-loop integration

When using the server without internal threading (e.g. with
`listen_socket(false)` or with `start_method(EXTERNAL_SELECT)`), you can
drive the event loop yourself:

* **`bool webserver::run()`** — process pending events once and return
  immediately.
* **`bool webserver::run_wait(int32_t millisec)`** — block until events
  are available or the timeout expires.
* **`bool webserver::get_fdset(void* read, void* write, void* except, int* max_fd)`**
  — retrieve file descriptor sets for use with `select(2)`.
* **`bool webserver::get_timeout(uint64_t* timeout)`** — the maximum
  time to wait before calling `run()` again.
* **`bool webserver::add_connection(int socket, const sockaddr* addr, socklen_t len)`**
  — hand off an externally-accepted connection to the daemon. Used with
  socket-activation or load-balancer integrations.
* **`int webserver::quiesce()`** — stop accepting new connections while
  allowing in-flight requests to complete. Returns the listen socket FD,
  which the caller can then close or pass elsewhere.

### Stopping the daemon

* **`bool webserver::stop()`** — stop the daemon, join libmicrohttpd's
  worker threads, and return. **Calling `stop()` from inside a handler
  deadlocks** (it joins the calling thread); see [Threading
  contract](#threading-contract).
* **`void webserver::stop_and_wait()`** — equivalent to `stop()` plus a
  drain that waits for every in-flight handler to return. Same deadlock
  contract as `stop()`.

A small example combining everything:

```cpp
// Bind to an OS-chosen port, print the actual one, drive the loop
// externally, then drain on shutdown.
webserver ws{create_webserver(0).start_method(http::http_utils::EXTERNAL_SELECT)};
ws.start(false);
std::cout << "listening on port " << ws.get_bound_port() << '\n';
while (running) {
    ws.run_wait(1000);
}
ws.quiesce();
ws.stop_and_wait();
```

See [`examples/daemon_info.cpp`](examples/daemon_info.cpp) and
[`examples/external_event_loop.cpp`](examples/external_event_loop.cpp)
for runnable demonstrations.

## HTTP utils

libhttpserver provides a set of constants and helpers to help you build
your HTTP server. The full list of named constants (status codes, common
methods, common content types, named algorithms) lives in
[`src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp`](src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) — it
would be redundant to enumerate it here.

The following utility functions are available on `http::http_utils`:

* **`const char* reason_phrase(unsigned int status_code)`** — the
  standard HTTP reason phrase for a given status code (e.g. `"OK"` for
  200, `"Not Found"` for 404).
* **`bool is_feature_supported(int feature)`** — whether a specific
  libmicrohttpd feature is supported on the current system. Feature
  constants are defined by the `MHD_FEATURE` enum.
* **`const char* get_mhd_version()`** — the version string of the
  underlying libmicrohttpd library.

## Lifecycle hooks

The hook bus is the single extension surface for observing or
short-circuiting the request lifecycle. It replaces v1's single-slot
patchwork (one `log_access` callback, one `not_found_handler`, one
`method_not_allowed_handler`, one `internal_error_handler`, one
`auth_handler`) with eleven distinct phases spanning connection,
request, routing, handler, and response. Each phase accepts multiple
subscribers and is observable both server-wide (via `webserver::add_hook`)
and, for the five post-route-resolution phases, per-route (via
`http_resource::add_hook`). The contract is captured in DR-012 and
[`specs/architecture/04-components/hooks.md`](specs/architecture/04-components/hooks.md).

Each call returns a move-only `hook_handle`. The handle's destructor
removes the registration; `hook_handle::detach()` disarms the destructor
so the registration persists for the webserver's lifetime.

### Phases

| Phase | Fires at | Short-circuit | Per-route eligible |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| `connection_opened` | New TCP / TLS connection accepted by MHD | No | No |
| `accept_decision` | After the default-policy / block-list verdict; the connection has been accepted or denied | No | No |
| `request_received` | Request line and headers parsed, body not yet consumed | Yes (`hook_action`) | No |
| `body_chunk` | Each upload-body chunk delivered by MHD | Yes (`hook_action`) | No |
| `route_resolved` | After URL → resource resolution; carries the matched route or "no match" | No | No |
| `before_handler` | After route resolution and method check, immediately before the handler runs | Yes (`hook_action`) | Yes |
| `handler_exception` | Exception escapes the handler, before `internal_error_handler` is consulted | Yes (`hook_action`) | Yes |
| `after_handler` | Handler returned a response, before it is queued on the wire (mutation point) | Yes (`hook_action`) | Yes |
| `response_sent` | Response handed to `MHD_queue_response`; carries `status`, `bytes_queued`, `elapsed` | No | Yes |
| `request_completed` | Request lifecycle finished (success or failure); last hook to fire per request | No | Yes |
| `connection_closed` | Connection torn down (peer close or server close) | No | No |

### Short-circuit semantics

Phases marked "Short-circuit" return a `hook_action`:
`hook_action::pass()` lets the chain continue;
`hook_action::respond_with(response)` aborts the chain at that
position. The wrapped response is sent on the wire in place of any
handler output. Subsequent hooks in the same phase are not invoked.
Observation-only phases (`connection_opened`, `accept_decision`,
`connection_closed`, `route_resolved`, `response_sent`,
`request_completed`) ignore the return; the chain always runs to
completion.

### Per-route hooks

`http_resource::add_hook(phase, fn)` accepts only the five
post-route-resolution phases: `before_handler`, `handler_exception`,
`after_handler`, `response_sent`, `request_completed`. Per-route hooks
fire after the server-wide chain at the same phase, and only if that
server-wide chain did not short-circuit. Passing any other phase
throws `std::invalid_argument` naming the rejected phase. See
[`examples/per_route_auth.cpp`](examples/per_route_auth.cpp) for a
worked example.

### Examples

* [`examples/denied_ip_log.cpp`](examples/denied_ip_log.cpp) — log every
  denied-IP rejection via a single `accept_decision` hook.
* [`examples/early_413.cpp`](examples/early_413.cpp) — return 413 from
  a `request_received` hook before the body is consumed.
* [`examples/clf_access_log.cpp`](examples/clf_access_log.cpp) — write
  a Common Log Format access line from a `response_sent` hook.
* [`examples/per_route_auth.cpp`](examples/per_route_auth.cpp) —
  per-route HTTP Basic auth via `http_resource::add_hook(before_handler, ...)`.

### v1 aliases

Each of the v1 single-slot setters is an alias for an `add_hook` call
at the corresponding phase. The aliases survive for ergonomic call
sites; new code can use either form.

| v1 setter | Equivalent `add_hook` call |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| `log_access(fn)` | `ws.add_hook(hook_phase::response_sent, fn)` |
| `not_found_handler(fn)` | `ws.add_hook(hook_phase::route_resolved, fn)` |
| `method_not_allowed_handler(fn)` | `ws.add_hook(hook_phase::before_handler, fn)` |
| `internal_error_handler(fn)` | `ws.add_hook(hook_phase::handler_exception, fn)` |
| `auth_handler(fn)` | `ws.add_hook(hook_phase::before_handler, fn)` |

The aliases install observation-stub hooks under the same dispatch
plumbing, so the on-the-wire behaviour is identical regardless of
which form the caller used.

## Threading contract

Distilled from
[`specs/architecture/05-cross-cutting.md`](specs/architecture/05-cross-cutting.md)
§5.1 and DR-008
([`specs/architecture/11-decisions/DR-008.md`](specs/architecture/11-decisions/DR-008.md)):

1. **Public methods on `webserver` are thread-safe and re-entrant from
   inside a handler.** Two exceptions: `stop()` and `~webserver()`
   **deadlock** if invoked from a handler thread, because they wait for
   that very thread to drain. `stop_and_wait()` delegates to `stop()`
   and carries the same deadlock risk. Stop the server from a different
   thread, or signal an external stop loop. v2 provides both `stop()`
   (signal and return) and `stop_and_wait()` (signal and drain until
   all in-flight handlers finish).
2. **Handlers run concurrently on libmicrohttpd worker threads.** The
   same lambda or `http_resource` instance is invoked from many threads
   at once. Any state you share — counters, caches, file handles — must
   be synchronised on your side. The library does not synchronise user
   state for you.
3. **`http_request` is single-threaded per request.** Sharing one
   `http_request` across threads is undefined; the per-request arena
   makes no guarantees outside the calling thread.
4. **`http_response` is value-typed with exclusive ownership.**
   Returning it transfers ownership into the dispatcher. There is no
   shared mutable response object.
5. **User-supplied callbacks** — `log_access`, `log_error`,
   `not_found_handler`, `method_not_allowed_handler`,
   `internal_error_handler`, `file_cleanup_callback`, PSK / SNI / ALPN
   callbacks, and any registered `render_*` — may run concurrently on
   multiple threads. Implementations MUST be thread-safe.

## Error propagation

Distilled from
[`specs/architecture/05-cross-cutting.md`](specs/architecture/05-cross-cutting.md)
§5.2 and DR-009
([`specs/architecture/11-decisions/DR-009.md`](specs/architecture/11-decisions/DR-009.md)):

1. **A handler that throws `std::exception` is caught.** The library
   logs the exception via the configured `log_error` callback and then
   invokes `internal_error_handler(request, e.what())`. The response
   returned by `internal_error_handler` is sent to the client; if no
   custom `internal_error_handler` is configured, a default 500 with
   the **fixed body `"Internal Server Error"`** is sent
   (DR-009 Revision 1, CWE-209 fix — exception text often contains
   file paths, SQL fragments, or attacker-influenced input and must
   not cross a process boundary to an untrusted client). To restore
   the v1 behaviour of including the exception message in the body
   for development, set `.expose_exception_messages(true)` on the
   builder. The verbatim message is still surfaced via the
   `log_error` callback and to any configured
   `internal_error_handler` regardless of the flag.
2. **A handler that throws something other than `std::exception`** is
   also caught, with `"unknown exception"` substituted for the message.
   The same default body (`"Internal Server Error"`) applies; the
   `"unknown exception"` sentinel reaches the wire only when
   `.expose_exception_messages(true)` is set.
3. **Library-internal failures during dispatch** (allocation, body
   materialisation) flow through the same `internal_error_handler` path.
4. **If `internal_error_handler` itself throws**, the library logs and
   sends a hardcoded 500 with an empty body. There is no third level of
   fallback.
5. **`feature_unavailable` is a normal `std::runtime_error`** — no
   special status mapping. Catch it explicitly if you want to map it to
   a 503 or similar; the library does not.
6. **There is no throw-as-status idiom.** A handler that wants to
   return 404, 400, etc. builds the response by value (see
   [Response](#response)):
   `return httpserver::http_response::empty().with_status(404);`.

Install custom error handlers on the builder:

```cpp
auto cfg = httpserver::create_webserver(8080)
    .not_found_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&) {
        return httpserver::http_response::string("nope").with_status(404);
    })
    .method_not_allowed_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&) {
        return httpserver::http_response::empty().with_status(405);
    })
    .internal_error_handler([](const httpserver::http_request&, std::string_view what) {
        // CWE-209: 'what' may contain file paths, SQL fragments, or
        // attacker-influenced input. Log it internally; do NOT echo
        // it to the HTTP client.
        (void)what;  // e.g. logger->error(what);
        return httpserver::http_response::string("Internal Server Error").with_status(500);
    });
httpserver::webserver ws{cfg};
```

See [`examples/custom_error.cpp`](examples/custom_error.cpp) for a
worked example. Note that the snippet above — which echoes `what`
verbatim to the wire — is illustrative of the explicit-handler case;
the **default** (no `internal_error_handler` configured) path now
sends a fixed body, and only the `log_error` callback receives the
verbatim message. To restore the v1 verbose-body default for
development, chain `.expose_exception_messages(true)` on the builder
(see [Custom error handlers](#custom-error-handlers)).

## Feature availability

Several capabilities are gated by build-time flags. v2.0 makes the
gating visible at the API level so application code does not need
preprocessor guards on `HAVE_*` macros.

| Build flag | When disabled | Public-API behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `HAVE_BAUTH` | Basic-auth disabled | `get_user`, `get_pass` return empty `string_view`; `features().basic_auth == false`; `create_webserver::basic_auth(true)` throws `feature_unavailable` at `webserver` construction |
| `HAVE_DAUTH` | Digest-auth disabled | `get_digested_user` returns empty; `check_digest_auth` returns a sentinel result; `features().digest_auth == false`; `create_webserver::digest_auth(true)` throws `feature_unavailable` |
| `HAVE_GNUTLS` | TLS disabled | All `get_client_cert_*` accessors return empty / `-1` / `false`; `features().tls == false`; `create_webserver::use_ssl(true)` throws `feature_unavailable` |
| `HAVE_WEBSOCKET` | WebSocket disabled | `register_ws_resource` throws `feature_unavailable`; `features().websocket == false` |

### Probing at runtime

`webserver::features()` returns a small struct of four `bool`s — one
per flag — so callers can branch without preprocessor help:

```cpp
if (ws.features().tls) {
    // safe to read client-certificate accessors on this build
}
if (ws.features().websocket) {
    ws.register_ws_resource("/sock", std::make_unique<my_socket>());
}
```

### `feature_unavailable`

Derives from `std::runtime_error`. Its `what()` names both the disabled
feature and the build flag that gates it, so log lines pinpoint which
flag a deployment is missing. Catch it where you call a feature-gated
method:

```cpp
try {
    ws.register_ws_resource("/sock", std::make_unique<my_socket>());
} catch (const httpserver::feature_unavailable& e) {
    std::cerr << "websocket support is not available: " << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

Deny lists, IP-allow handling, and similar features that do not depend
on external libraries are always available: `webserver::deny_ip(addr)` /
`webserver::remove_denied_ip(addr)` and `webserver::allow_ip(addr)` /
`webserver::remove_allowed_ip(addr)` install and clear per-server access
rules at runtime regardless of build flags.

## Migrating from v1

If you're porting an application from the v1 line, the rename / removed /
added cheat sheet — every API surface that moved — lives in
[`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md). The packaging is
parallel-installable across major versions, so applications can link
the major they need side by side while porting.

## Examples

Every example is a standalone program under [`examples/`](examples/). A
fully grouped index — with one-line descriptions of every binary — lives
in [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md). The summary below points
to the canonical example for each topic covered in this manual.

### Start here

* [`examples/hello_world.cpp`](examples/hello_world.cpp) — ten lines, lambda
  form, no subclass, no raw pointer. Reproduced byte-for-byte at the top
  of this README.
* [`examples/shared_state.cpp`](examples/shared_state.cpp) — when the
  class form is the right shape: an `http_resource` subclass with a
  mutex-guarded counter shared between `render_get` and `render_post`.

### HTTP basics

* [`examples/setting_headers.cpp`](examples/setting_headers.cpp) — fluent
  `with_header` chaining.
* [`examples/hello_with_get_arg.cpp`](examples/hello_with_get_arg.cpp) —
  read a query-string parameter from `http_request::get_arg`.
* [`examples/args_processing.cpp`](examples/args_processing.cpp) —
  iterate every form / query argument.
* [`examples/url_registration.cpp`](examples/url_registration.cpp) —
  exact paths, prefix matches, parameterised segments, per-segment regex.
* [`examples/handlers.cpp`](examples/handlers.cpp) — distinct lambdas
  for GET and POST on the same path; the dispatcher composes them.
* [`examples/allowing_disallowing_methods.cpp`](examples/allowing_disallowing_methods.cpp)
  — narrow a resource to a specific subset of HTTP verbs.
* [`examples/custom_error.cpp`](examples/custom_error.cpp) — install
  `not_found_handler`, `method_not_allowed_handler`, and `internal_error_handler`.

### Response shapes

* [`examples/minimal_file_response.cpp`](examples/minimal_file_response.cpp) —
  stream a file from disk via `http_response::file`.
* [`examples/binary_buffer_response.cpp`](examples/binary_buffer_response.cpp) —
  return a binary buffer (e.g. a PNG) from memory.
* [`examples/iovec_response_example.cpp`](examples/iovec_response_example.cpp) —
  gather a response body from multiple borrowed buffers without copying.
* [`examples/pipe_response_example.cpp`](examples/pipe_response_example.cpp) —
  stream from a pipe filled by a background thread.
* [`examples/empty_response_example.cpp`](examples/empty_response_example.cpp) —
  bodyless responses for DELETE and HEAD.
* [`examples/minimal_deferred.cpp`](examples/minimal_deferred.cpp) — body
  produced asynchronously by a callback.
* [`examples/deferred_with_accumulator.cpp`](examples/deferred_with_accumulator.cpp) —
  deferred response that mutates shared state across calls.

### TLS and authentication

* [`examples/minimal_https.cpp`](examples/minimal_https.cpp) — enable
  TLS with PEM key / cert files.
* [`examples/minimal_https_psk.cpp`](examples/minimal_https_psk.cpp) —
  TLS with pre-shared keys.
* [`examples/basic_authentication.cpp`](examples/basic_authentication.cpp) —
  per-request HTTP Basic auth inside the handler.
* [`examples/centralized_authentication.cpp`](examples/centralized_authentication.cpp) —
  server-wide `auth_handler` and `auth_skip_paths`.
* [`examples/digest_authentication.cpp`](examples/digest_authentication.cpp) —
  per-request HTTP Digest auth via `check_digest_auth`.
* [`examples/client_cert_auth.cpp`](examples/client_cert_auth.cpp) —
  mutual TLS with X.509 client certificates.

### Lifecycle hooks

* [`examples/denied_ip_log.cpp`](examples/denied_ip_log.cpp) — log every
  denied-IP rejection from a single `accept_decision` hook (issue #332).
* [`examples/early_413.cpp`](examples/early_413.cpp) — short-circuit
  oversized uploads with 413 before any body bytes are consumed via a
  `request_received` hook (issue #273).
* [`examples/clf_access_log.cpp`](examples/clf_access_log.cpp) —
  Common Log Format access logger written as a `response_sent` hook
  using the structured `status` / `bytes_queued` / `elapsed` context
  fields (issues #281 and #69).
* [`examples/per_route_auth.cpp`](examples/per_route_auth.cpp) —
  per-route HTTP Basic auth via `http_resource::add_hook(before_handler,
  ...)` that does not touch sibling routes (DR-012).

### Operations

* [`examples/daemon_info.cpp`](examples/daemon_info.cpp) — introspect
  the running daemon (bound port, listen FD, active connections).
* [`examples/external_event_loop.cpp`](examples/external_event_loop.cpp) —
  drive `EXTERNAL_SELECT` from the application's loop via `run_wait`.
* [`examples/custom_access_log.cpp`](examples/custom_access_log.cpp) —
  server-wide access-log callback.
* [`examples/minimal_ip_access_control.cpp`](examples/minimal_ip_access_control.cpp) —
  `deny_ip` / `allow_ip` under the `ACCEPT` and `REJECT` policies.
* [`examples/turbo_mode.cpp`](examples/turbo_mode.cpp) — turbo,
  suppressed Date header, fastopen queue, listen backlog.
* [`examples/service.cpp`](examples/service.cpp) — kitchen-sink
  reference example: CLI args, optional TLS, every `render_*` override.

### File uploads

* [`examples/file_upload.cpp`](examples/file_upload.cpp) — multipart
  upload through `http_request::get_files`.
* [`examples/file_upload_with_callback.cpp`](examples/file_upload_with_callback.cpp) —
  upload with a `file_cleanup_callback`.

### WebSockets

* [`examples/websocket_echo.cpp`](examples/websocket_echo.cpp) —
  `websocket_handler` subclass registered via `register_ws_resource`.

### Benchmarks

* [`examples/benchmark_select.cpp`](examples/benchmark_select.cpp),
  [`examples/benchmark_threads.cpp`](examples/benchmark_threads.cpp),
  [`examples/benchmark_nodelay.cpp`](examples/benchmark_nodelay.cpp) —
  micro-benchmarks.
